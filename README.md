# GitHub Copilot CLI for Beginners [Work in Progress]

Learn to supercharge your development workflow with AI-powered command-line assistance.

## What You'll Learn

This hands-on course takes you from zero to productive with GitHub Copilot CLI. You'll work with a single Python book collection app throughout all chapters, progressively improving it using AI-assisted workflows. By the end, you'll confidently use AI to review code, generate tests, debug issues, and automate workflows: all from your terminal.

**No AI experience required.** If you can use a terminal, you can learn this.

**Perfect for:** Developers, students, and anyone who has experience with software development.

## Who This Course Is For

This course is designed for:

- **Software Developers** who want to use AI from the command line
- **Terminal users** who prefer keyboard-driven workflows over IDE integrations
- **Teams looking to standardize** AI-assisted code review and development practices

---

## What Is GitHub Copilot CLI?

**GitHub Copilot CLI brings AI assistance directly to your terminal.** Instead of switching to a browser or code editor, you can ask questions, review code, generate tests, and debug issues without leaving your command line.

Think of it as having a knowledgeable colleague available 24/7 who can read your code, explain confusing patterns, and help you work faster.
