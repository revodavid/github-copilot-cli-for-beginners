# GitHub Copilot CLI for Beginners [Work in Progress]

Learn to supercharge your development workflow with AI-powered command-line assistance.

## What You'll Learn

This hands-on course takes you from zero to productive with GitHub Copilot CLI. You'll work with a single Python book collection app throughout all chapters, progressively improving it using AI-assisted workflows. By the end, you'll confidently use AI to review code, generate tests, debug issues, and automate workflows: all from your terminal.

**No AI experience required.** If you can use a terminal, you can learn this.

**Perfect for:** Developers, students, and anyone who has experience with software development.

## Who This Course Is For

This course is designed for:

- **Software Developers** who want to use AI from the command line
- **Terminal users** who prefer keyboard-driven workflows over IDE integrations
- **Teams looking to standardize** AI-assisted code review and development practices

---

## What Is GitHub Copilot CLI?

**GitHub Copilot CLI brings AI assistance directly to your terminal.** Instead of switching to a browser or code editor, you can ask questions, review code, generate tests, and debug issues without leaving your command line.

Think of it as having a knowledgeable colleague available 24/7 who can read your code, explain confusing patterns, and help you work faster.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

✅ **GitHub account**: [Create one free](https://github.com/signup)<br>
✅ **GitHub Copilot access**: [Free offering](https://github.com/features/copilot/plans), [Monthly subscription](https://github.com/features/copilot/plans), or [Free for students/teachers](https://education.github.com/pack)<br>
✅ **Terminal basics**: Comfortable with `cd`, `ls`, running commands<br>
✅ **Python 3.10+**: For running the sample book app (pre-installed in Codespaces)

## Quick Start

### Fastest: Open in Codespaces (Recommended)

This repo includes a dev container with Python, pytest, and Copilot CLI pre-installed:

1. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/github/github-copilot-cli-for-beginners/fork)
2. Click **Code** > **Codespaces** > **Create codespace on main**
3. Run: `cd samples/book-app-project && python book_app.py list`

### Alternative: Local Install

```bash
# Install (choose one)
npm install -g @github/copilot    # All platforms
brew install copilot-cli          # macOS/Linux
winget install GitHub.Copilot     # Windows

# Start an interactive session and authenticate
copilot
> /login    # The > indicates you're typing inside the Copilot session

# See the magic - ask about the sample book app
copilot -p "What does @samples/book-app-project/book_app.py do?"
```

Want more details? Head to [Chapter 00](./00-quick-start/README.md) for the full quick start experience.

## How This Course Works

Each chapter follows the same pattern:

1. **Real-World Analogy**: Understand the concept through familiar comparisons
2. **Core Concepts**: Learn the essential knowledge
3. **Hands-On Examples**: Run actual commands and see results
4. **Assignment**: Practice what you learned
5. **What's Next**: Preview of the following chapter

**Code examples are runnable.** Every copilot text block in this course can be copied and run in your terminal.

## Quick Reference Card

Need a cheat sheet? The **[Quick Reference Card](./QUICK-REFERENCE.md)** has all commands, syntax, and workflows on one page.

A PDF version is also available: [QUICK-REFERENCE.pdf](./QUICK-REFERENCE.pdf)

### Keeping It Updated

The Quick Reference can be automatically updated using Copilot CLI itself:

```bash
npm install

# Update content by scanning docs with Copilot, then generate PDF
npm run refresh

# Or run steps separately:
npm run update:reference  # Uses Copilot CLI to scan docs and update content
npm run generate:pdf      # Generates PDF from markdown
```
