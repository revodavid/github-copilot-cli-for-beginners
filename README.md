# GitHub Copilot CLI for Beginners [Work in Progress]

Learn to supercharge your development workflow with AI-powered command-line assistance.

## What You'll Learn

This hands-on course takes you from zero to productive with GitHub Copilot CLI. By the end, you'll confidently use AI to review code, generate tests, debug issues, and automate workflows: all from your terminal.

**No AI experience required.** If you can use a terminal, you can learn this.

**Perfect for:** Developers, students, and anyone who uses a terminal daily.

## Understanding the GitHub Copilot Family

GitHub Copilot has evolved into a family of AI-powered tools. Here's where each one lives:

| Product | Where It Runs | Description |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| [**GitHub Copilot CLI**](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/cli-getting-started) (this course) | Your terminal |  Terminal-native AI coding assistant  |
| [**GitHub Copilot**](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot) | VS Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains, etc. | Agent mode, chat, inline suggestions  |
| [**Copilot on GitHub.com**](https://github.com/copilot) | GitHub | Immersive chat about your repos, create agents, and more |
| [**GitHub Copilot coding agent**](https://docs.github.com/copilot/using-github-copilot/using-copilot-coding-agent-to-work-on-tasks) | GitHub  | Assign issues to agents, get PRs back |

This course focuses on **GitHub Copilot CLI**, bringing AI assistance directly to your terminal.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- [ ] **GitHub account**: [Create one free](https://github.com/signup)
- [ ] **GitHub Copilot access**: [Free for students/teachers](https://education.github.com/pack), get started with the [Free option](https://github.com/features/copilot/plans), or [Monthly subscription](https://github.com/features/copilot/plans)
- [ ] **Node.js LTS**: [Download here](https://nodejs.org/) (for npm installation)
- [ ] **Terminal basics**: Comfortable with `cd`, `ls`, running commands

## Quick Start

Can't wait? Run this in your terminal right now:

```bash
# Install (choose one)
npm install -g @github/copilot    # All platforms
brew install copilot-cli          # macOS/Linux
winget install GitHub.Copilot     # Windows

# Start and authenticate
copilot
> /login

# See the magic
copilot -p "Explain what GitHub Copilot CLI can do for developers"
```

Want more details? Head to [Chapter 00](./00-quick-start/README.md) for the full quick start experience.

## How This Course Works

Each chapter follows the same pattern:

1. **Real-World Analogy**: Understand the concept through familiar comparisons
2. **Core Concepts**: Learn the essential knowledge
3. **Hands-On Examples**: Run actual commands and see results
4. **Assignment**: Practice what you learned
5. **What's Next**: Preview of the following chapter

**Code examples are runnable.** Every copilot text block in this course can be copied and run in your terminal.

## Quick Reference Card

Need a cheat sheet? The **[Quick Reference Card](./QUICK-REFERENCE.md)** has all commands, syntax, and workflows on one page.

A PDF version is also available: [QUICK-REFERENCE.pdf](./QUICK-REFERENCE.pdf)

### Keeping It Updated

The Quick Reference can be automatically updated using Copilot CLI itself:

```bash
npm install

# Update content by scanning docs with Copilot, then generate PDF
npm run refresh

# Or run steps separately:
npm run update:reference  # Uses Copilot CLI to scan docs and update content
npm run generate:pdf      # Generates PDF from markdown
```

## Glossary

Quick reference for technical terms used throughout this course:
