![Chapter 04: Agents and Custom Instructions](images/chapter-header.png)

> **What if you could hire a frontend expert, backend expert, and security expert... all in one tool?**

In this chapter, you'll transform Copilot from a generalist into a team of specialists. You'll create agents with deep domain expertise: a frontend expert who automatically adds accessibility and TypeScript, a backend specialist who enforces security best practices, and more. You'll see how the same prompt produces dramatically better results when a specialist handles it, and learn to orchestrate multiple agents collaborating on a single feature.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to:

- Use built-in agents: Plan (`/plan`), Code-review (`/review`), and understand automatic agents (Explore, Task)
- Create specialized agents using agent files (`.agent.md`)
- Use agents for domain-specific tasks
- Delegate work across multiple agents
- Write custom instruction files for project-specific standards

## 🚀 Start Here: Your First 5 Minutes with Agents

**New to agents?** Here's the quickest path to understanding them:

1. **Try a built-in agent right now:**
   ```bash
   copilot
   > /plan Add user authentication to my Express app
   ```
   This invokes the Plan agent to create a step-by-step implementation plan.

2. **Understand the core concept:** Agents are like hiring a specialist instead of asking a generalist. A "frontend agent" automatically thinks about accessibility, TypeScript, and React patterns - you don't have to remind it.

3. **Two ways to use custom agents:**
   - **`/agent`** - Select an agent interactively *inside* a session
   - **`copilot --agent frontend`** - Start a session *with* a specific agent

Once you've tried the built-in agents, read on to create your own custom agents.

## Real-World Analogy: Hiring Specialists

When you need help with your house, you don't call one "general helper." You call specialists:

| Problem | Specialist | Why |
|---------|------------|-----|
| Leaky pipe | Plumber | Knows plumbing codes, has specialized tools |
| Rewiring | Electrician | Understands safety requirements, up to code |
| New roof | Roofer | Knows materials, local weather considerations |

Agents work the same way. Instead of a generic AI, you get specialists who understand specific domains deeply.

*Direct specialists, don't do everything yourself: Frontend, Backend, Security, and Testing experts at your command*

---

## Built-in Agents

Copilot CLI includes four built-in agents:

| Agent | How to Invoke | What It Does |
|-------|---------------|--------------|
| **Plan** | `/plan` or `Shift+Tab` | Creates step-by-step implementation plans before coding |
| **Code-review** | `/review` | Reviews staged/unstaged changes with focused, actionable feedback |
| **Explore** | *Automatic* | Used internally when you ask Copilot to explore or analyze the codebase |
| **Task** | *Automatic* | Executes commands like tests, builds, lints, and dependency installs |

### Using Built-in Agents

```bash
copilot

# Invoke the Plan agent to create an implementation plan
> /plan Add user authentication to my Express app

# Invoke the Code-review agent on your changes
> /review

# Explore and Task agents are invoked automatically when relevant:
> Run the test suite        # Uses Task agent
> Explore how auth works    # Uses Explore agent
```

**Key insight**: You directly invoke Plan and Code-review with slash commands. Explore and Task work behind the scenes. Copilot uses them automatically when appropriate.

### Understanding the Task Agent

The Task agent deserves special attention because of its smart output handling:

| Outcome | What You See |
|---------|--------------|
| ✅ **Success** | Brief summary (e.g., "All 247 tests passed", "Build succeeded") |
| ❌ **Failure** | Full output with stack traces, compiler errors, and detailed logs |

**Why this design?** It keeps your conversation context clean. You don't need 500 lines of passing test output - you just need to know it worked. But when something breaks, you get all the details needed to debug.

**Example prompts that use the Task agent:**
```bash
> Run the tests
> Build the project
> Install the dependencies
> Run the linter on src/
```

The Task agent uses a faster model since it's focused on command execution rather than complex reasoning.

## Creating Your First Agent

Agents can be defined in several locations. Choose based on your use case:

| Location | Scope | Best For |
|----------|-------|----------|
| `~/.copilot/agents/` | Global (all projects) | Personal productivity agents you use everywhere |
| `.github/agents/` | Project-specific | Team-shared agents with project conventions |
| `*.agent.md` files | Single-file | Quick experiments, VS Code compatibility |

### Which Location Should I Use?

```
Are you just experimenting?
    └─ YES → Create `my-agent.agent.md` in your current folder
    └─ NO ↓

Will your team use this agent?
    └─ YES → Create in `.github/agents/` (gets version controlled)
    └─ NO ↓

Do you want this agent everywhere?
    └─ YES → Create in `~/.copilot/agents/` (your personal agents)
```

**Start simple:** Create a single `*.agent.md` file in your project folder. Move it to a permanent location once you're happy with it.

### Agent File Structure

Let's start with a **minimal agent** to understand the format:

Create `my-reviewer.agent.md` in your project folder:

```markdown
# Code Reviewer

You are a code reviewer focused on finding bugs and security issues.

When reviewing code, always check for:
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Missing error handling
- Hardcoded secrets
```

That's it! Just 8 lines. Now Copilot applies these checks whenever you use this agent.

### A More Complete Example

Once you're comfortable, here's a more comprehensive agent. Create `~/.copilot/agents/frontend.agent.md`:

```markdown
# Frontend Agent

You are a frontend development specialist with expertise in React, TypeScript, and modern CSS.

**Your focus areas:**
- Component architecture using atomic design (organizing components from small to large: atoms → molecules → organisms)
- Performance optimization (lazy loading, memoization)
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance - Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)
- Responsive design patterns

**Code style requirements:**
- Use functional components with hooks
- TypeScript strict mode
- CSS modules (no inline styles)
- All components must have PropTypes or TypeScript interfaces

**When reviewing code, always check:**
- Bundle size impact
- Render performance
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader compatibility
```

### Using the Agent

Select an agent interactively or via command line:

```bash
# Select from available agents interactively
copilot
> /agent

# Start with a specific agent
copilot --agent frontend

# The frontend agent knows to:
# - Use React functional components
# - Add ARIA labels for accessibility
# - Consider mobile-first responsive design
# - Use CSS modules for styling
```

---

## Multiple Agent Files

Create separate agent files for different specialties. Here are examples for a complete team:

> 💡 **Note for beginners**: The examples below use specific libraries and tools. Don't worry if you don't know them all - **replace them with whatever your project uses**. The important thing is the *structure* of the agent, not the specific technologies.
>
> **Common terms you'll see:**
> - **Zustand** - A simple state management library for React (like Redux but simpler)
> - **Zod** - A TypeScript library for validating data shapes
> - **React Query** - A library for fetching and caching server data
> - **MSW** - Mock Service Worker, for faking API calls in tests
> - **Prisma** - A database toolkit that makes database queries type-safe

**`~/.copilot/agents/frontend.agent.md`**:

```markdown

## Generic vs Specialist: See the Difference

This is where agents prove their value. Watch the difference:

### Without an Agent (Generic Copilot)

```bash
copilot

> Create a form component for user registration
```

**Generic output**:
```jsx
function RegistrationForm() {
  return (
    <form>
      <input type="text" name="username" />
      <input type="email" name="email" />
      <input type="password" name="password" />
      <button type="submit">Register</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

Basic. Works. But missing a lot.

---

### With the Frontend Agent

```bash
copilot

> /agent
# Select "frontend"

> Create a form component for user registration
```

**Specialist output**:
```tsx
interface RegistrationFormProps {
  onSubmit: (data: UserRegistrationData) => Promise<void>;
  initialValues?: Partial<UserRegistrationData>;
}

export const RegistrationForm: React.FC<RegistrationFormProps> = ({
  onSubmit,
  initialValues
}) => {
  const [errors, setErrors] = useState<FormErrors>({});
  const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = useState(false);

  // Form validation with real-time feedback
  const validateField = useCallback((field: string, value: string) => { ... });

  return (
    <form
      onSubmit={handleSubmit}
      aria-labelledby="registration-heading"
      noValidate
    >
      <h2 id="registration-heading" className={styles.visuallyHidden}>
        Create Account
      </h2>

      <FormField
        label="Username"
        name="username"
        required
        aria-describedby="username-requirements"
        error={errors.username}
      />
      <span id="username-requirements" className={styles.hint}>
        3-20 characters, letters and numbers only
      </span>

      {/* ... proper TypeScript, accessibility, error handling ... */}

      <button
        type="submit"
        disabled={isSubmitting}
        aria-busy={isSubmitting}
      >
        {isSubmitting ? 'Creating Account...' : 'Register'}
      </button>
    </form>
  );
};
```

**What the frontend agent automatically includes**:
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces with strict typing
- ✅ ARIA labels for screen readers
- ✅ Keyboard navigation support
- ✅ Loading states with aria-busy
- ✅ Real-time validation
- ✅ CSS modules (no inline styles)
- ✅ Error boundaries consideration

**The difference**: Same prompt, dramatically better output. The agent brings expertise you'd forget to ask for.

## Multi-Agent Collaboration

The real power comes when specialists work together on a feature.

### Example: Building a Comments System

```bash
copilot

> I need to add a comments feature to my blog. Users can add, edit, and delete their own comments.

# Get backend architecture first
> /agent
# Select "backend"

> Design the comments API:
> - Database schema
> - REST endpoints
> - Authorization rules

# Backend agent responds with:
# - PostgreSQL schema with foreign keys
# - RESTful endpoints (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE)
# - JWT-based ownership checks
# - Input validation with Zod

# Now get the UI from the frontend specialist
> /agent
# Select "frontend"

> Design React components for the comments system:
> - CommentList
> - CommentForm
> - CommentItem (with edit/delete for owner)

# Frontend agent responds with:
# - TypeScript components with proper interfaces
# - Optimistic updates for better UX
# - Accessibility (keyboard navigation, ARIA)
# - Loading and error states

# Synthesize both designs
> Now create an implementation plan that combines the backend API and frontend components.
> Show the data flow and how they connect.
```

**The key insight**: You're the architect directing specialists. They handle the details, you handle the vision.

## Using Agents in Practice

### Single Agent Tasks

```bash
# Start Copilot with the frontend agent
copilot --agent frontend

> Create a user profile card component that displays:
> - Avatar image
> - User name and title
> - Contact button
> - Social links

# The frontend agent applies all its specialized standards
```

<details>
<summary>🎬 See it in action!</summary>

![Security Expert Demo](images/security-expert-demo.gif)

</details>

### Switching Agents Mid-Session

```bash
copilot

> I need to add a "favorites" feature where users can save items.

# Switch to frontend agent for UI design
> /agent
# Select "frontend" from the list
> Design the UI components for favorites

# Switch to backend agent for API
> /agent
# Select "backend"
> Design the API endpoints for favorites

# Switch to testing agent
> /agent
# Select "testing"
> Generate tests for the favorites feature
```

### Agent as Tools

When agents are configured, Copilot can also call them as tools during complex tasks. If you ask for a full-stack feature, Copilot may automatically delegate parts to the appropriate specialist agents.

---

## Agent Naming Best Practices

Good agent names are short, descriptive, and indicate the specialty:

| ✅ Good Names | ❌ Avoid |
|--------------|----------|
| `frontend` | `my-agent` |
| `backend-api` | `agent1` |
| `security-reviewer` | `helper` |
| `react-specialist` | `code` |
| `python-backend` | `assistant` |

**Naming conventions:**
- Use lowercase with hyphens: `my-agent-name.agent.md`
- Include the domain: `frontend`, `backend`, `devops`, `security`
- Be specific when needed: `react-typescript` vs just `frontend`

---

## Project-Level Instructions

Custom instructions let you encode team standards so Copilot applies them automatically. There are two ways to set them up:

### Quick Setup with /init

Use `/init` to create instructions for your repository:

```bash
copilot
> /init
```

This generates configuration files that customize Copilot's behavior for your project.

### COPILOT.md File

The `/init` command creates a `COPILOT.md` (or similar) file in your repo. This file contains project-specific instructions:

```markdown
# Project Instructions

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer functional components in React
- Use async/await over callbacks

## Security Requirements
- Always use parameterized queries
- Sanitize all user input
- Never log sensitive data

## Testing Standards
- Minimum 80% coverage for new code
- Use Jest for unit tests
- Use Playwright for E2E tests
```

### Custom Instruction Files (.instructions.md)

For more granular control, create instruction files in `.github/instructions/`:

```
.github/
└── instructions/
    ├── typescript-standards.instructions.md
    ├── security-checklist.instructions.md
    └── api-design.instructions.md
```

**Example: `.github/instructions/typescript-standards.instructions.md`**

```markdown
# TypeScript Standards

Apply these standards to all TypeScript files in this project.

## Type Safety
- Enable strict mode in tsconfig.json
- Avoid `any` type; use `unknown` when type is truly unknown
- Use type guards for runtime type checking
- Prefer interfaces over type aliases for object shapes

## Naming Conventions
- PascalCase for types, interfaces, and classes
- camelCase for variables, functions, and methods
- SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Prefix interfaces with `I` only when needed to distinguish from classes

## Error Handling
- Use custom error classes extending Error
- Always include error codes for API errors
- Type catch blocks with `unknown`, then narrow

## Async Patterns
- Use async/await over .then() chains
- Handle all promise rejections
- Use Promise.all for concurrent operations
```

**Finding community instruction files**: Browse [github/awesome-copilot](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot) for pre-made instruction files covering .NET, Angular, Azure, Python, Docker, and many more technologies.

### Disabling Custom Instructions

If you want Copilot to ignore project-specific configurations:

```bash
copilot --no-custom-instructions
```

---

## 🎯 Try It Yourself

After completing the demos, try these variations:

1. **Agent Comparison Challenge**: Ask for the same thing with and without an agent:
   ```bash
   # Without agent
   copilot
   > Create a login form component

   # With frontend agent
   copilot
   > /agent
   # Select "frontend" from the list
   > Create a login form component
   ```
   Compare the outputs. What did the agent add that generic Copilot missed?

2. **Multi-Agent Challenge**: Design a "user profile" feature using backend agent for API, frontend agent for UI. Can you synthesize them into one implementation plan?

3. **Create Your Own Agent**: Create a simple agent file at `~/.copilot/agents/my-agent.agent.md` with just 5 lines of instructions. Test it with `/agent` and select "my-agent".

**Self-Check**: You understand agents when you can explain why having a "security agent" review code is better than just asking "check for security issues."

---

## Hands-On Examples

### Example 1: Create Your Own Agent

```bash

# Create the agents directory
mkdir -p ~/.copilot/agents

# Create a code reviewer agent
cat > ~/.copilot/agents/reviewer.agent.md << 'EOF'
# Code Reviewer Agent

You are a senior code reviewer focused on code quality.

**Review priorities:**
1. Security vulnerabilities
2. Performance issues
3. Maintainability concerns
4. Best practice violations

**Output format:**
Provide issues as a numbered list with severity tags:
[CRITICAL], [HIGH], [MEDIUM], [LOW]
EOF

# Create a documentation agent
cat > ~/.copilot/agents/documentor.agent.md << 'EOF'
# Documentation Agent

You are a technical writer who creates clear documentation.

**Documentation standards:**
- Start with a one-sentence summary
- Include usage examples
- Document parameters and return values
- Note any gotchas or limitations
EOF

# Now use them
copilot --agent reviewer
> Review @src/utils.js

# Or switch agents
copilot
> /agent
# Select "documentor"
> Document @src/utils.js
```

### Example 2: Agent-Driven Feature Development

```bash

# Start with frontend expertise
copilot --agent frontend

> I need a comment system for blog posts. Users can add, edit, and delete their own comments.
> Design the comment UI components

# Switch to backend for API design
> /agent
# Select "backend"
> Design the comments API endpoints and database schema

# Let Copilot synthesize everything
> Create an implementation plan that combines the UI and API designs
```

## Sample Files

### Sample AGENTS.md

Save this as `samples/agents/AGENTS.md`:

```markdown
# Sample AGENTS.md

## Analyst

You analyze code and provide insights without making changes.

**Analysis types:**
- Complexity analysis (cyclomatic complexity)
- Dependency analysis (coupling, cohesion)
- Security analysis (OWASP top 10)
- Performance analysis (Big O, bottlenecks)

## Refactorer

You improve code structure without changing behavior.

**Refactoring principles:**
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Extract method for long functions (>20 lines)
- Replace conditionals with polymorphism
- Remove dead code

## Optimizer

You improve performance of existing code.

**Optimization targets:**
- Reduce time complexity
- Minimize memory allocations
- Eliminate redundant operations
- Add caching where appropriate
```

---

## Assignment

### Main Challenge: Build Your Team

1. Create an `AGENTS.md` file with at least 3 agents relevant to a project you work on
2. Each agent should have:
   - Clear expertise area
   - Specific code standards
   - Output format preferences
3. Use each agent to complete a task
4. Have agents collaborate on a feature

**Success criteria**: You have agents that improve your workflow and produce consistent, high-quality output.

### Bonus Challenge: Instruction Library

Create a `.github/instructions/` folder with at least 3 instruction files:
- `security-audit.md` for security reviews
- `api-documentation.md` for documenting APIs
- `migration-guide.md` for planning migrations

Test each instruction file on real code in your project.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Agent not found

Check that the agent file exists in one of these locations:
- `~/.copilot/agents/`
- `.github/agents/`

List available agents:

```bash
copilot
> /agent
# Shows all available agents
```

### Agent not following instructions

Be explicit in your prompts and add more detail to agent definitions:
- Specific frameworks/libraries with versions
- Team conventions
- Example code patterns

### Custom instructions not loading

Run `/init` in your project to set up project-specific instructions:

```bash
copilot
> /init
```

Or check if they're disabled:
```bash
# Don't use --no-custom-instructions if you want them loaded
copilot  # This loads custom instructions by default
```

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Built-in agents**: `/plan` and `/review` are directly invoked; Explore and Task work automatically
2. **Custom agents** are specialists defined in `.agent.md` files
3. **Good agents** have clear expertise, standards, and output formats
4. **Multi-agent collaboration** solves complex problems by combining expertise
5. **Instruction files** (`.instructions.md`) encode team standards for automatic application
6. **Consistent output** comes from well-defined agent instructions

## What's Next

Agents change *how* Copilot thinks. Now let's add new *capabilities* with the Skills system.

In **[Chapter 05: Skills System](../05-skills/README.md)**, you'll learn:

- Installing community skills
- Creating custom skills
- How skills auto-trigger from prompts
- When to use skills vs agents
