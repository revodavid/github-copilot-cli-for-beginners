![Chapter 00: Quick Start](images/chapter-header.png)

Welcome! In this chapter, you'll get GitHub Copilot CLI (Command Line Interface) installed, signed in with your GitHub account, and verified that everything works. This is a quick setup chapter. Once you're up and running, the real demos start in Chapter 01!

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you'll have:

- Installed GitHub Copilot CLI
- Signed in with your GitHub account
- Verified it works with a simple test

> ⏱️ **Estimated Time**: ~25 minutes (10 min reading + 15 min hands-on)

---

## Prerequisites

- **GitHub Account** with Copilot access. [See subscription options](https://github.com/features/copilot/plans)). Students/Teachers can access copilot [free via GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/pack).
- **Terminal basics**: Comfortable with commands like `cd` and `ls`
- **[Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**: Used to run the sample book app used throughout this course. If you don't have Python, the Codespaces option below includes it pre-installed.

### What "Copilot Access" Means

GitHub Copilot CLI requires an active Copilot subscription. You can check your status at [github.com/settings/copilot](https://github.com/settings/copilot). You should see one of:

- **Copilot Individual** - Personal subscription
- **Copilot Business** - Through your organization
- **Copilot Enterprise** - Through your enterprise
- **GitHub Education** - Free for verified students/teachers

If you see "You don't have access to GitHub Copilot," you'll need to use the free option, subscribe to a plan, or join an organization that provides access.

## Installation

> ⏱️ **Time estimate**: Installation takes 2-5 minutes. Authentication adds another 1-2 minutes.

### Recommended: GitHub Codespaces (Zero Setup)

If you don't want to install any of the prerequisites, you can use GitHub Codespaces, which has the GitHub Copilot CLI ready to go (you'll need to sign in), pre-installs Python 3.13, pytest, and the GitHub CLI.

1. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/github/github-copilot-cli-for-beginners/fork) to your GitHub account
2. Click **Code** > **Codespaces** > **Create codespace on main**
3. Wait for the container to build (~2 minutes)
4. You're ready to go! The terminal will open automatically in the Codespace environment.

> 💡 **Verify in Codespace**: Run `cd samples/book-app-project && python book_app.py help` to confirm Python and the sample app are working.

### Alternative: Local Installation

Choose the method that works for your system:

### All Platforms (npm)

```bash
# If you have Node.js installed, this is a quick way to get the CLI
npm install -g @github/copilot
```

### macOS/Linux (Homebrew)

```bash
brew install copilot-cli
```

### Windows (WinGet)

```bash
winget install GitHub.Copilot
```

### macOS/Linux (Install Script)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://gh.io/copilot-install | bash
```

---

## Authentication

Open a terminal window, start the CLI, and sign in using the `/login` command:

```bash
copilot
> /login
```

**What happens next:**

1. Copilot displays a one-time code (like `ABCD-1234`)
2. Your browser opens to GitHub's device authorization page
3. Enter the code when prompted
4. Click "Authorize" to grant GitHub Copilot CLI access
5. Return to your terminal - you're now signed in!

**Tip**: The sign-in persists across sessions. You only need to do this once unless your token expires or you explicitly sign out.

---

## Verify It Works

### Step 1: Test Copilot CLI

```bash
copilot
> Say hello and tell me what you can help with
> /exit
```

<details>
<summary>🎬 See it in action!</summary>

![Hello Demo](images/hello-demo.gif)

*Demo output varies — your model, tools, and responses will differ from what's shown here.*

</details>

**Expected output**: A friendly response listing Copilot's capabilities.

### Step 2: Run the Sample Book App

This course uses a Python book collection app throughout all chapters. Verify it works:

```bash
cd samples/book-app-project
python book_app.py list
```

**Expected output**: A list of 5 books including "The Hobbit", "1984", and "Dune".

### Step 3: Try Copilot with the Book App

Navigate back to the repository root first (if you ran Step 2):

```bash
cd ..   # Back to the repository root if needed
copilot 
> What does @samples/book-app-project/book_app.py do?
> /exit
```

**Expected output**: A summary of the book app's main functions and commands.

## ✅ You're Ready!

That's it for installation. The real fun starts in Chapter 01, where you'll:

- Watch AI review the book app and find code quality issues instantly
- Learn three different ways to use Copilot
- Generate working code from plain English

**[Continue to Chapter 01: First Steps →](../01-setup-and-first-steps/README.md)**

## Troubleshooting

### "copilot: command not found"

The CLI isn't installed. Try a different installation method:

```bash
# If brew failed, try npm:
npm install -g @github/copilot

# Or the install script:
curl -fsSL https://gh.io/copilot-install | bash
```

### "You don't have access to GitHub Copilot"

1. Verify you have a Copilot subscription at [github.com/settings/copilot](https://github.com/settings/copilot)
2. Check that your organization permits CLI access if using a work account

### "Authentication failed"

Re-authenticate:

```bash
copilot
> /login
```

### Browser doesn't open automatically

Manually visit [github.com/login/device](https://github.com/login/device) and enter the code shown in your terminal.

### Token expired

Simply run `/login` again:

```bash
copilot
> /login
```

### Still stuck?

- Check the [GitHub Copilot CLI documentation](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli)
- Search [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues)
