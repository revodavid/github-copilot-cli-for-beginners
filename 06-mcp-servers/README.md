![Chapter 06: MCP Servers](images/chapter-header.png)

> **What if Copilot could read your GitHub issues, check your database, and create PRs... all from the terminal?**

In this chapter, you'll connect Copilot to the outside world using MCP (Model Context Protocol). You'll configure servers for GitHub, filesystem access, and documentation, then experience the magic of going from "Get issue #42" to "Create a PR with the fix" - all without leaving your terminal. You'll also learn to build your own MCP servers to connect any API you need.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to:

- Understand what MCP is and why it matters
- Manage MCP servers using `/mcp` commands
- Configure MCP servers for GitHub, filesystem, and documentation
- Use MCP in your daily workflows
- Build a basic custom MCP server

> ⏱️ **Estimated Time**: ~45 minutes (20 min reading + 25 min hands-on)

---

## 🚀 Start Here: MCP in 30 Seconds

**What is MCP?** It connects Copilot to external services (GitHub, databases, APIs) so it can read real data instead of just analyzing files.

**Quickest way to see it work:** The GitHub MCP is included by default. Try this:

```bash
copilot
> List my recent pull requests
```

If it works, MCP is already set up! If not, this chapter shows you how.

**Time estimate:** Basic setup takes ~10-15 minutes. Most time is spent getting a GitHub token.

---

## Real-World Analogy: Browser Extensions

Think of MCP servers like browser extensions:

| Extension | What It Does |
|-----------|--------------|
| Password manager | Connects browser to your vault |
| GitHub | Adds GitHub features to any page |
| Grammarly | Connects to writing analysis service |

MCP servers do the same thing for Copilot. They connect it to external services so it can read GitHub issues, query databases, fetch documentation, and more.

## What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a standard for connecting AI assistants to external data sources.

**Without MCP:**
```bash
> What's in GitHub issue #42?

"I don't have access to GitHub. You'll need to copy and paste the issue content."
```

**With MCP:**
```bash
> What's in GitHub issue #42 of this repository?

Issue #42: Login fails with special characters
Status: Open
Labels: bug, priority-high
Description: Users report that passwords containing...
```

MCP makes Copilot aware of your actual development environment.

---

## Managing MCP Servers

Use the `/mcp` command to manage MCP servers:

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/mcp show` | Show all configured MCP servers and their status |
| `/mcp add` | Interactive setup for adding a new server |
| `/mcp edit <server-name>` | Edit an existing server configuration |
| `/mcp enable <server-name>` | Enable a disabled server |
| `/mcp disable <server-name>` | Temporarily disable a server |
| `/mcp delete <server-name>` | Remove a server permanently |

### Example: Check Your MCP Servers

```bash
copilot

> /mcp show

MCP Servers:
✓ github (enabled) - GitHub integration
✓ filesystem (enabled) - File system access
✗ postgres (disabled) - PostgreSQL database

> /mcp enable postgres
Server 'postgres' enabled.
```

## MCP Configuration File

MCP servers are configured in `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json` (global) or `.copilot/mcp-config.json` (project).

### Understanding the JSON Format

> 💡 **New to JSON?** JSON is just a way to write configuration data. Here's what each part means:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "server-name": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@package/server-name"],
      "tools": ["*"]
    }
  }
}
```

| Field | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| `"mcpServers"` | Container for all your MCP server configurations |
| `"server-name"` | A name you choose (e.g., "github", "filesystem") |
| `"type": "local"` | The server runs on your machine |
| `"command": "npx"` | The program to run (npx runs npm packages) |
| `"args": [...]` | Arguments passed to the command |
| `"tools": ["*"]` | Allow all tools from this server |

**Important JSON rules:**
- Use double quotes `"` for strings (not single quotes)
- No trailing commas after the last item
- File must be valid JSON (use a [JSON validator](https://jsonlint.com/) if unsure)

---

## MCP Server 1: Filesystem

Access files with advanced capabilities beyond basic `@` syntax.

### Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": "npx",  // Runs npm packages without global install
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/project"],
      "tools": ["*"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Usage

Once configured, the filesystem MCP provides tools that Copilot can use automatically:

```bash
copilot

> List all markdown files in the docs folder

Found 12 markdown files:
- docs/README.md
- docs/getting-started.md
- docs/api/endpoints.md
...

> What are the file statistics for the src directory?

src/ statistics:
- Total files: 47
- JavaScript: 32 files (68%)
- TypeScript: 10 files (21%)
- JSON: 5 files (11%)
- Total lines: 4,230

> Find all TODO comments in the codebase

Found 8 TODO comments:
- src/api/users.js:23 - TODO: Add pagination
- src/services/auth.js:45 - TODO: Implement refresh tokens
...
```

---

## MCP Server 2: GitHub

The GitHub MCP server is **built-in** - if you logged into Copilot (which you did during initial setup), it already works. No configuration needed!

> 💡 **Not working?** Run `/login` to re-authenticate with GitHub.

### What You Can Do

| Feature | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| **Issues** | List, create, search, and comment on issues |
| **Pull requests** | View PRs, diffs, create PRs, check status |
| **Code search** | Search across repositories |
| **Actions** | Query workflow runs and status |
| **Copilot Spaces** | Access collaborative workspaces |

### Usage

```bash
copilot

> List open issues labeled "bug" in this repository

Open bugs (5):
#42 - Login fails with special characters (high priority)
#38 - Dashboard loading slow (medium priority)
#35 - Email notifications not sending (high priority)
...

> Tell me about issue #42

Issue #42: Login fails with special characters
Opened by: jsmith (3 days ago)
Labels: bug, priority-high
Assignee: none

Description:
Users report that passwords containing special characters
like !@#$ fail to authenticate, even though they work
during registration...

Comments (2):
- @devteam: Confirmed. Reproduces with password "test!@#"
- @security: Likely an encoding issue in the auth endpoint

> Create a pull request for my current branch with a description

Created PR #45: Fix special character handling in authentication
Base: main
Head: feature/fix-special-chars
Status: Ready for review
```

---

## MCP Server 3: Context7 (Documentation)

Context7 gives Copilot access to up-to-date documentation for popular frameworks and libraries. Instead of relying on training data that might be outdated, Copilot fetches the actual current documentation.

**Supported documentation sources include:**
- React, Vue, Angular, Svelte
- Node.js, Express, Fastify
- TypeScript, JavaScript
- PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis
- And many more...

### Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"],
      "tools": ["*"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Setup Requirements

✅ **No API key required** - Context7 works out of the box
✅ **No account needed** - Just add the configuration
✅ **Automatic updates** - Documentation is fetched in real-time

**That's it!** Once configured, Copilot automatically uses Context7 when you ask about frameworks or libraries.

### Usage

```bash
copilot

> What's the best practice for useEffect cleanup in React?

From React Documentation:

## useEffect Cleanup

Effects can return a cleanup function that runs before
the component unmounts or before the effect runs again:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = props.source.subscribe();
  return () => {
    subscription.unsubscribe();
  };
}, [props.source]);
```

Common cleanup scenarios:
- Unsubscribing from subscriptions
- Cancelling fetch requests
- Clearing timeouts/intervals
- Removing event listeners

> How do I implement this in my UserProfile component?

# Copilot now knows the official React patterns
# and can apply them to your specific code
```

## Issue to Fix to PR: Without Leaving Terminal

This is the moment developers say "I never want to work without this again."

<img src="images/issue-to-pr-workflow.png" alt="Issue to PR Workflow using MCP - Shows the complete flow from getting a GitHub issue through creating a pull request" width="800"/>

*Complete Issue-to-PR workflow: GitHub MCP retrieves issues and creates PRs, Filesystem MCP finds code, Context7 MCP provides best practices, and Copilot handles analysis and fixes*

### The Complete Workflow (No Copy-Paste, No Context Switching)

```bash
copilot

> Get the details of GitHub issue #42

Issue #42: Login fails with special characters in password
Status: Open
Priority: High
Reporter: jsmith (3 days ago)

Description:
Users report that passwords containing special characters like !@#$
fail to authenticate, even when they worked during registration.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create account with password "Test!@#123"
2. Log out
3. Try to log in - fails with "Invalid credentials"

Comments:
- @devteam: Confirmed. Issue is in password encoding.
- @security: High priority - blocking some users from logging in.

> Find the authentication code that handles login

Found: src/auth/login.js

[Shows relevant code with the password handling function]

> Based on the issue and the code, what's causing this bug?

Analysis:
Line 34 passes the password through encodeURIComponent()
before hashing. Special characters are encoded differently
during login vs registration, causing hash mismatch.

Fix: Remove encoding or apply consistently in both places.

> Fix the bug and create a pull request that references issue #42

✓ Created branch: fix/issue-42-special-chars
✓ Modified: src/auth/login.js (removed duplicate encoding)
✓ Modified: tests/auth.test.js (added special char test cases)
✓ Created PR #48: Fix special character handling in authentication

PR URL: https://github.com/org/repo/pull/48
```

**The result**: Issue investigation → root cause analysis → fix implementation → PR creation. **Zero copy-paste. Zero context switching. One terminal session.**

## Multi-Server Workflows

The real power comes from combining servers:

<img src="images/multi-server-workflow.png" alt="Multi-Server MCP Workflow" width="800"/>

*Combine GitHub, Filesystem, and Documentation servers for powerful integrated workflows*

```bash
copilot

# Step 1: Understand the issue from GitHub
> Tell me about issue #42

# Step 2: Find related code
> Search for "authenticate" in the src directory

# Step 3: Get best practices
> What are the best practices for input sanitization in authentication?

# Step 4: Synthesize a solution
> Based on the issue, the code, and best practices, suggest a fix

# Step 5: Create the PR
> Create a pull request with this fix
```

### Example: Complete Bug Investigation

```bash
copilot

> Get the details of issue #42
# Learn about the bug

> Show me src/auth/login.js
# See the relevant code

> What are the best practices for password validation?
# Understand the right approach

> Analyze the bug and suggest a fix based on what we found

# Copilot synthesizes information from all three sources

> Implement the fix

> Create a pull request titled "Fix: Handle special characters in password validation"
```

---

## Complete Configuration File

Here's a full `mcp-config.json` with filesystem and Context7 servers:

> 💡 **Note:** GitHub MCP is built-in - you don't need to add it to your config file. It uses your `/login` authentication automatically.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "."],
      "tools": ["*"]
    },
    "context7": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"],
      "tools": ["*"]
    }
  }
}
```

Save this as `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json` for global access or `.copilot/mcp-config.json` for project-specific configuration.

---

## Web Access with web_fetch

Copilot CLI includes a built-in `web_fetch` tool that can retrieve content from URLs. You can control which URLs are accessible via your configuration:

```json
// ~/.copilot/config.json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allowedUrls": [
      "https://api.github.com/**",
      "https://docs.github.com/**",
      "https://*.npmjs.org/**"
    ],
    "blockedUrls": [
      "http://**"  // Block non-HTTPS URLs
    ]
  }
}
```

**Usage:**
```bash
copilot

> Fetch and summarize the README from https://github.com/facebook/react
```

---

## Building a Custom MCP Server (Advanced)

> 📖 **Want to connect Copilot to your own APIs?** See the [Custom MCP Server Guide](mcp-custom-server.md) for a complete walkthrough on building your own server with TypeScript. Additional details can be found in the [MCP for Beginners course](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp-for-beginners).
>
> This is completely optional - the pre-built servers (GitHub, filesystem, Context7) cover most use cases.

---

## 🎯 Try It Yourself

After completing the demos, try these variations:

1. **MCP Status Check**: Run `/mcp show` to see what servers are configured. If GitHub isn't set up, try adding it with your token.

2. **Documentation Challenge**: If Context7 MCP is configured, ask for official documentation on a framework you use:
   ```bash
   copilot
   > Show me the React documentation for useEffect cleanup patterns
   ```

3. **Workflow Challenge**: Try the complete issue-to-PR workflow on a real (or test) repository. Even if you don't have issues, you can create one and immediately work through it.

**Self-Check**: You understand MCP when you can explain why "Get GitHub issue #42" is better than copying and pasting issue content into the prompt.

---

## Assignment

### Main Challenge: Configure and Use MCP

1. Verify GitHub MCP works (it's built-in): run `copilot` then `List my open PRs`
2. Set up `mcp-config.json` with the filesystem server
3. Use MCP to:
   - List files in your project using the filesystem server
   - Get information about an issue or PR using the GitHub server
   - Create a workflow that uses both servers

**Success criteria**: You can seamlessly access GitHub and filesystem data from within Copilot.

<details>
<summary>💡 Hints (click to expand)</summary>

**Step 1: Verify GitHub MCP**
```bash
copilot
> List my open pull requests
# If this works, GitHub MCP is already set up!
# If not, run: /login
```

**Step 2: Create the config file**

Create `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json` (or use `/mcp add`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "."],
      "tools": ["*"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Important JSON tips:**
- Use double quotes `"` (not single quotes)
- No trailing commas after the last item
- Validate at [jsonlint.com](https://jsonlint.com/) if you get errors

**Step 3: Test the workflow**
```bash
copilot
> /mcp show
# Should show filesystem as enabled

> List all JavaScript files in this project
# Uses filesystem MCP

> What issues are assigned to me?
# Uses GitHub MCP
```

**If MCP isn't working:** Restart Copilot after editing the config file.

### Bonus Challenge: Build a Custom MCP Server

Ready to go deeper? Follow the [Custom MCP Server Guide](mcp-custom-server.md) to build your own server that connects to any API.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "MCP server not found"

Check that:
1. The npm package exists: `npm view @modelcontextprotocol/server-github`
2. Your configuration is valid JSON
3. The server name matches your config

Use `/mcp show` to see the current configuration.

### "GitHub authentication failed"

The built-in GitHub MCP uses your `/login` credentials. Try:

```bash
copilot
> /login
```

This will re-authenticate you with GitHub. If issues persist, check that your GitHub account has the necessary permissions for the repository you're accessing.

### "MCP server failed to start"

Check the server logs:
```bash
# Run the server command manually to see errors
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github
```

### MCP tools not available

Make sure the server is enabled:
```bash
copilot

> /mcp show
# Check if server is listed and enabled

> /mcp enable server-name
# Enable if disabled
```

---

## 🔮 Also Available: Plugins

Copilot CLI also supports a **plugin system** for installing community extensions:

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/plugin list` | See installed plugins |
| `/plugin marketplace` | Browse available plugins |
| `/plugin install <name>` | Install a plugin |
| `/plugin uninstall <name>` | Remove a plugin |
| `/plugin update` | Update installed plugins |

As the plugin ecosystem grows, this will become another way to extend Copilot's capabilities. For now, MCP servers cover most extensibility needs.

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **MCP** connects Copilot to external services
2. **Common servers** include filesystem, GitHub, and documentation
3. **Configuration** lives in `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json`
4. **Multi-server workflows** combine data from multiple sources
5. **Custom servers** let you connect any API
6. **Manage servers** with the `/mcp` command
7. **Plugins** provide another way to extend Copilot (emerging feature)

> 📋 **Quick Reference**: See the [Command Cheat Sheet](../QUICK-REFERENCE.md) for a complete list of commands and shortcuts.
