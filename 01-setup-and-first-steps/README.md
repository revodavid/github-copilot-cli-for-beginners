## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to:

- Experience why developers call this "having a senior engineer on speed dial"
- Choose the right mode (Interactive, Plan, or Programmatic) for any task
- Use essential slash commands to control your sessions

> ⏱️ **Estimated Time**: ~50 minutes (20 min reading + 30 min hands-on)

---

## Getting Comfortable: Your First Prompts

Before diving into the impressive demos, let's start with some simple prompts you can try right now. **No code repository needed**! Just open a terminal and start Copilot:

```bash
copilot
```

Try these beginner-friendly prompts:

```
> Explain what a dataclass is in Python in simple terms

> Write a function that sorts a list of dictionaries by a specific key

> What's the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?

> Give me 5 best practices for writing clean Python code
```

Notice how natural it feels. Just ask questions like you would to a colleague. When you're done exploring, type `/exit` to leave the session.

**The key insight**: GitHub Copilot CLI is conversational. You don't need special syntax to get started. Just ask questions in plain English.

## See It In Action

Now let's see why developers are calling this "having a senior engineer on speed dial."

> 📖 **Reading the Examples**: Lines starting with `>` are prompts you type inside an interactive Copilot session. Lines without a `>` prefix are shell commands you run in your terminal.

> 💡 **About Example Outputs**: The sample outputs shown throughout this course are illustrative. Because Copilot's responses vary each time, your results will differ in wording, formatting, and detail. Focus on the *type* of information returned, not the exact text.

### Demo 1: Code Review in Seconds

The course includes sample files with intentional code quality issues. Let's review one:

```bash
# Clone the course repository (if you haven't already)
git clone https://github.com/github/github-copilot-cli-for-beginners
cd github-copilot-cli-for-beginners

# Start Copilot
copilot
```

Once inside the interactive session:

```
> Review @samples/book-app-project/book_app.py for code quality issues and suggest improvements
```

> 💡 **What's the `@`?** The `@` symbol tells Copilot to read a file. You'll learn all about this in Chapter 02 - for now, just copy the command exactly as shown.

<details>
<summary>🎬 See it in action!</summary>

![Code Review Demo](images/code-review-demo.gif)

*Demo output varies — your model, tools, and responses will differ from what's shown here.*

</details>

**What happens** (your output will look different - Copilot's responses vary each time):

```
Code Quality Review: book_app.py

MEDIUM: Missing Type Hints (throughout)
    Most functions lack type hints
    Fix: Add type hints for better code clarity and IDE support
    Example: def handle_add() -> None:

MEDIUM: Weak Input Validation (lines 32-37)
    Code: year = int(year_str) if year_str else 0
    Issue: Doesn't validate year is reasonable (e.g., not negative, not far future)
    Fix: Add range validation: if year < 0 or year > 2100: raise ValueError

LOW: If/Elif Chain Could Be Dict (lines 82-94)
    Long if/elif chain for command routing
    Consider: Command pattern or dict mapping for cleaner code
    More maintainable as commands grow

LOW: Global State (line 6)
    Global collection instance makes testing harder
    Consider: Pass collection as parameter or use dependency injection

Summary: 4 main issues found - focus on type hints and validation
```

**The takeaway**: A professional code review in seconds. Manual review would take...well...more time than that!

### Demo 2: Explain Confusing Code

Ever stared at code wondering what it does? Try this in your Copilot session:

```
> Explain what this does in simple terms:
> @samples/book-app-project/books.py
```

<details>
<summary>🎬 See it in action!</summary>

![Explain Code Demo](images/explain-code-demo.gif)

*Demo output varies — your model, tools, and responses will differ from what's shown here.*

</details>

**What happens**:

```
This is a book collection management module using Python dataclasses.

Think of it like a digital bookshelf:
- Book is a dataclass - a simple way to store book information (title, author, year, read status)
- BookCollection manages the entire collection and handles saving/loading

Key components:

1. @dataclass decorator (line 8)
   - Automatically creates __init__, __repr__, etc.
   - Clean way to define data structures in Python

2. BookCollection class (line 16)
   - Maintains a list of Book objects
   - Handles persistence with JSON file I/O
   - load_books() reads from data.json
   - save_books() writes to data.json using asdict()

3. Book operations:
   - add_book() - creates and saves new books
   - find_book_by_title() - searches collection
   - mark_as_read() - updates read status
   - find_by_author() - filters by author name

Common pattern: Read from JSON → Work with Python objects → Write back to JSON
```

**The takeaway**: Complex code explained like a patient mentor would explain it.

---

### Demo 3: Generate Working Code

Need a function you'd otherwise spend 15 minutes googling? Still in your session:

```
> Write a Python function that takes a list of books and returns statistics:
> total count, number read, number unread, oldest and newest book
```

<details>
<summary>🎬 See it in action!</summary>

![Generate Code Demo](images/generate-code-demo.gif)

*Demo output varies — your model, tools, and responses will differ from what's shown here.*

</details>

**What happens**: A complete, working function in seconds that you can copy-paste-run.

When you're done exploring, exit the session:

```
> /exit
```

**The takeaway**: Instant gratification, and you stayed in one continuous session the whole time.

---

You've just seen what Copilot CLI can do. Now let's understand *how* to use these capabilities effectively. The key is knowing which of the three interaction modes to use for different situations.

---

## Real-World Analogy: Learning to Drive

Think of GitHub Copilot CLI like a car with three driving modes:

| Mode | Car Analogy | When to Use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Interactive** | Rally driver with co-driver | Exploring, iterating, real-time guidance as you go |
| **Plan** | GPS navigation | Complex tasks where you want to see the route first |
| **Programmatic** | Self-driving car | Automation, scripts, CI/CD - set the destination and let it run |

Just like driving, you'll naturally learn when each mode feels right.

<img src="images/learning-to-drive-analogy.png" alt="Three Modes of GitHub Copilot CLI" width="800"/>

*Choose your mode based on the task: Interactive for real-time collaboration, Plan for seeing the route first, Programmatic for hands-off automation*

### Which Mode Should I Start With?

**Start with Interactive mode.** It's the most forgiving and helps you learn:
- You can experiment and ask follow-up questions
- Context builds naturally through conversation
- Mistakes are easy to correct with `/clear`

Once you're comfortable, try:
- **Programmatic mode** (`-p`) for quick, one-off questions
- **Plan mode** (`/plan`) when you need to think before coding

---

## The Three Modes

### Mode 1: Interactive Mode

**Best for**: Exploration, iteration, multi-turn conversations

Start an interactive session:

```bash
copilot
```

You'll see a prompt where you can type naturally:

```
> /help

Available commands:
  /help     - Show this help message
  /clear    - Clear conversation history
  /model    - Show or change the AI model
  /exit     - Exit the session

> What's the best way to handle file I/O errors in Python?

[Copilot explains try/except, context managers, and specific exception types]

> Show me an example with reading a JSON file

[Copilot builds on the previous context to show a JSON file example]

> /exit
```

**Key insight**: Interactive mode maintains context. Each message builds on previous ones, just like a real conversation.

#### Interactive Mode Example

```bash
copilot

# In the session:
> Review @samples/book-app-project/utils.py and suggest improvements
> Add type hints to all functions
> Make the error handling more robust
> /exit
```

Notice how each prompt builds on the previous answer. You're having a conversation, not starting over each time.

---

### Mode 2: Plan Mode

**Best for**: Complex tasks where you want to review the approach before execution

Plan mode shows you a step-by-step plan before writing any code. Use the `/plan` command or press **Shift+Tab** to toggle Plan Mode:

> 💡 **Tip**: **Shift+Tab** is a keyboard shortcut that toggles between regular mode and plan mode. Press it anytime during an interactive session to switch modes without typing a command.

```bash
copilot

> /plan Add a "mark as read" command to the book app
```

**Plan mode output:**

```
📋 Implementation Plan

Step 1: Update the command handler in book_app.py
  - Add new elif branch for "mark" command
  - Create handle_mark_as_read() function

Step 2: Implement the handler function
  - Prompt user for book title
  - Call collection.mark_as_read(title)
  - Display success/failure message

Step 3: Update help text
  - Add "mark" to available commands list
  - Document the command usage

Step 4: Test the flow
  - Add a book
  - Mark it as read
  - Verify status changes in list output

Proceed with implementation? [Y/n]
```

**Key insight**: Plan mode lets you review and modify the approach before any code is written. You see exactly what Copilot will do before it does it.

> 💡 **Want something more complex?** Try: `/plan Add search and filter capabilities to the book app` - Plan mode scales from simple features to full applications.

---

### Mode 3: Programmatic Mode

**Best for**: Automation, scripts, CI/CD, single-shot commands

Use the `-p` flag for one-time commands that don't need interaction:

```bash
# Analyze code
copilot -p "List all functions in @samples/book-app-project/book_app.py"

# Generate code
copilot -p "Write a function that checks if a number is even or odd"

# Get quick help
copilot -p "How do I read a JSON file in Python?"
```

**Key insight**: Programmatic mode gives you a quick answer and exits. No conversation, just input → output.

Once you're comfortable, you can use `-p` in shell scripts:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Generate commit messages automatically
COMMIT_MSG=$(copilot -p "Generate a commit message for: $(git diff --staged)")
git commit -m "$COMMIT_MSG"

# Review a file
copilot -p "Review @myfile.py for issues"
```

</details>

## Essential Slash Commands

These commands work in interactive mode. **Start with just these four** - they cover 90% of daily use:

| Command | What It Does | When to Use |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| `/help` | Show all available commands | When you forget a command |
| `/clear` | Clear conversation and start fresh | When switching topics |
| `/plan` | Plan your work out before coding | For more complex features |
| `/exit` | End the session | When you're done |

That's it for getting started! As you become comfortable, you can explore additional commands.

> 📚 **Official Documentation**: [CLI command reference](https://docs.github.com/copilot/reference/cli-command-reference) for the complete list of commands and flags.

### Quick Shell Commands

Run shell commands directly without AI by prefixing with `!`:

```bash
copilot

> !git status
# Runs git status directly, bypassing the AI

> !python -m pytest tests/
# Runs pytest directly
```

### The /delegate Command

The `/delegate` command hands off tasks to the [Copilot coding agent on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/copilot/using-github-copilot/using-copilot-coding-agent-to-work-on-tasks). This is a powerful way to get work done in the cloud without leaving your terminal.

```bash
copilot

> /delegate Complete the API integration tests and fix any failing edge cases

# Or use the & prefix shortcut:
> & Add error handling to the login function
```

### Switching Models

```bash
copilot
> /model

# Shows available models - these vary by subscription and region
```

</details>

---

## Hands-On Examples

### Example 1: Interactive Exploration

```bash
copilot

> Review @samples/book-app-project/book_app.py - what could be improved?

> Let's refactor the if/elif chain into a more maintainable structure

> Add type hints to all the handler functions

> /exit
```

### Example 2: Plan a Feature

```bash
copilot

> /plan Add a search feature to the book app that can find books by title or author

# Review the plan
# Approve or modify
# Watch it implement step by step
```

### Example 3: Automate with Programmatic Mode

```bash

# Review all Python files in the book app
for file in samples/book-app-project/*.py; do
  echo "Reviewing $file..."
  copilot -p "Quick code quality review of @$file - critical issues only"
done
```

---

## 🎯 Try It Yourself

After completing the demos, try these variations:

1. **Interactive Challenge**: Start `copilot` and explore the book app. Ask about `@samples/book-app-project/books.py` and request improvements 3 times in a row.

2. **Plan Mode Challenge**: Run `/plan Add rating and review features to the book app`. Read the plan carefully - does it make sense?

3. **Programmatic Challenge**: Run `copilot -p "List all functions in @samples/book-app-project/book_app.py and describe what each does"`. Did it work on the first try?

**Self-Check**: You understand the three modes when you can explain when NOT to use interactive mode (hint: one-off questions are faster with `-p`).

---

## Assignment

### Main Challenge: Master Interactive Mode

1. Start an interactive session: `copilot`
2. Ask Copilot to create a Python function that calculates factorials
3. Ask for error handling: "Add error handling for negative numbers"
4. Ask for a docstring: "Add a comprehensive docstring"
5. Observe how context carries between prompts
6. Exit with `/exit`

**Success criteria**: You should have a complete, documented factorial function with error handling, built through conversation.

<details>
<summary>💡 Hints (click to expand)</summary>

**Sample prompts to try:**
```bash
> Write a Python function that calculates the factorial of a number
> Add error handling for negative numbers and non-integers
> Add a comprehensive docstring with examples
```

**Common issues:**
- If Copilot asks clarifying questions, just answer them naturally
- Use `/clear` if you want to start over
- The context carries forward, so each prompt builds on the previous

</details>

### Bonus Challenge: Compare the Modes

Try this same task in all three modes:

1. **Interactive**: Build the function through conversation (as above)
2. **Plan**: Use `/plan Write a factorial function` to see the plan first
3. **Programmatic**: `copilot -p "Write a Python factorial function with error handling and docstring"`

**Reflection**: Which mode felt most natural? When would you use each?

<details>
<summary>🔧 <strong>Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

### Common Mistakes

| Mistake | What Happens | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Typing `exit` instead of `/exit` | Copilot treats "exit" as a prompt, not a command | Slash commands always start with `/` |
| Using `-p` for multi-turn conversations | Each `-p` call is isolated with no memory of previous calls | Use interactive mode (`copilot`) for conversations that build on context |
| Forgetting quotes around prompts with `$` or `!` | Shell interprets special characters before Copilot sees them | Wrap prompts in quotes: `copilot -p "What does $HOME mean?"` |

### Troubleshooting

**"Model not available"** - Your subscription may not include all models. Use `/model` to see what's available.

**"Context too long"** - Your conversation has used the full context window. Use `/clear` to reset, or start a new session.

**"Rate limit exceeded"** - Wait a few minutes and try again. Consider using programmatic mode for batch operations with delays.

</details>

## Key Takeaways

1. **Interactive mode** is for exploration and iteration - context carries forward
2. **Plan mode** is for complex tasks - review before implementation
3. **Programmatic mode** is for automation - no interaction needed
4. **Four essential commands** (`/help`, `/clear`, `/plan`, `/exit`) cover most daily use

> 📋 **Quick Reference**: See the [Command Cheat Sheet](../QUICK-REFERENCE.md) for a complete list of commands and shortcuts.

## What's Next

Now that you understand the three modes, let's learn how to give Copilot context about your code.

In **[Chapter 02: Context and Conversations](../02-context-conversations/README.md)**, you'll learn:

- The `@` syntax for referencing files and directories
- Session management with `--resume` and `--continue`
- How context management makes Copilot truly powerful
