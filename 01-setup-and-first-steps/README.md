## See It In Action

Before we learn the theory, let's see why developers are calling this "having a senior engineer on speed dial."

> 📖 **Reading the Examples**: Lines starting with `>` are prompts you type inside an interactive Copilot session. Lines without a prefix are shell commands you run in your terminal.

### Demo 1: Security Scan in Seconds

The course includes sample files with intentional bugs. Let's scan one:

```bash
# Clone the course repository (if you haven't already)
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/github-copilot-cli-for-beginners
cd github-copilot-cli-for-beginners

# Start Copilot
copilot
```

Once inside the interactive session:

```
> Review @samples/buggy-code/js/userService.js for security vulnerabilities
```

<details>
<summary>🎬 See it in action!</summary>

![Security Scan Demo](images/security-scan-demo.gif)

</details>

**What happens**:

```
Security Review: userService.js

CRITICAL: SQL Injection (line 13)
    Code: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`
    Risk: Attacker can access/delete entire database
    Fix: Use parameterized queries

CRITICAL: SQL Injection (line 29)
    Code: `UPDATE users SET name = '${data.name}'...`
    Risk: Same vulnerability in update operation

HIGH: Sensitive Data Logged (line 36)
    Code: console.log(`Login attempt: ${email} / ${password}`)
    Risk: Passwords visible in production logs

HIGH: Hardcoded Secret (line 59)
    Code: const JWT_SECRET = 'super-secret-key-12345'
    Risk: Anyone with code access can forge JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication tokens

Summary: 8 issues found (4 critical/high, 4 medium)
```

**The takeaway**: A professional security audit in seconds. Manual review would take...well...more time than that!

---

### Demo 2: Explain Confusing Code

Ever stared at code wondering what it does? Try this in your Copilot session:

```
> Explain this in simple terms: const debounce = (fn, ms) => { let t; return (...args) => { clearTimeout(t); t = setTimeout(() => fn(...args), ms); }; }
```

<details>
<summary>🎬 See it in action!</summary>

![Explain Code Demo](images/explain-code-demo.gif)

</details>

**What happens**:

```
This is a debounce function - it delays execution until activity stops.

Think of it like an elevator:
- When someone presses a button, the elevator doesn't move immediately
- It waits to see if more people are coming
- Only after a pause (ms milliseconds) does it actually move

How it works:
1. Takes a function (fn) and a delay time (ms)
2. Returns a new function that wraps the original
3. Each call resets the timer (clearTimeout)
4. The original function only runs after the delay passes with no new calls

Common uses:
- Search boxes that wait until you stop typing
- Window resize handlers that don't fire constantly
- Auto-save that triggers after you pause editing
```

**The takeaway**: Complex code explained like a patient mentor would explain it.

---

### Demo 3: Generate Working Code

Need a script you'd otherwise spend 15 minutes googling? Still in your session:

```
> Write a bash script that finds all files over 100MB and lists them by size
```

<details>
<summary>🎬 See it in action!</summary>

![Generate Script Demo](images/generate-script-demo.gif)

</details>

**What happens**: A complete, working script in seconds that you can copy-paste-run.

When you're done exploring, exit the session:

```
> /exit
```

**The takeaway**: Instant gratification, and you stayed in one continuous session the whole time.

---

You've just seen what Copilot CLI can do. Now let's understand *how* to use these capabilities effectively. The key is knowing which of the three interaction modes to use for different situations.

---

## Real-World Analogy: Learning to Drive

Think of GitHub Copilot CLI like a car with three driving modes:

| Mode | Car Analogy | When to Use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Interactive** | Rally driver with co-driver | Exploring, iterating, real-time guidance as you go |
| **Plan** | GPS navigation | Complex tasks where you want to see the route first |
| **Programmatic** | Self-driving car | Automation, scripts, CI/CD - set the destination and let it run |

Just like driving, you'll naturally learn when each mode feels right.

<img src="images/learning-to-drive-analogy.png" alt="Three Modes of GitHub Copilot CLI" width="800"/>

*Choose your mode based on the task: Interactive for real-time collaboration, Plan for seeing the route first, Programmatic for hands-off automation*

### Which Mode Should I Start With?

**Start with Interactive mode.** It's the most forgiving and helps you learn:
- You can experiment and ask follow-up questions
- Context builds naturally through conversation
- Mistakes are easy to correct with `/clear`

Once you're comfortable, try:
- **Programmatic mode** (`-p`) for quick, one-off questions
- **Plan mode** (`/plan`) when you need to think before coding

---

## The Three Modes

### Mode 1: Interactive Mode

**Best for**: Exploration, iteration, multi-turn conversations

Start an interactive session:

```bash
copilot
```

You'll see a prompt where you can type naturally:

```
> /help

Available commands:
  /help     - Show this help message
  /clear    - Clear conversation history
  /model    - Show or change the AI model
  /exit     - Exit the session

> What's the best way to handle errors in async JavaScript?

[Copilot explains try/catch, .catch(), and error boundaries]

> Show me an example with fetch()

[Copilot builds on the previous context to show a fetch example]

> /exit
```

**Key insight**: Interactive mode maintains context. Each message builds on previous ones, just like a real conversation.

#### Interactive Mode Example

```bash
copilot

# In the session:
> Create a Python class for managing a todo list
> Add a method to mark items as complete
> Add persistence using JSON file storage
> /exit
```

Notice how each prompt builds on the previous answer.

---

### Mode 2: Plan Mode

**Best for**: Complex tasks where you want to review the approach before execution

Plan mode shows you a step-by-step plan before writing any code. Use the `/plan` command or press **Shift+Tab** to toggle Plan Mode:

> 💡 **Tip**: You can also press **Shift+Tab** at any time to toggle between regular and plan modes.

```bash
copilot

> /plan Create a REST API for a blog with posts and comments using [Your_Language/Framework]
```

> 💡 **Replace `[Your_Language/Framework]`** with your preference, e.g., "Node.js with Express", "Python with FastAPI", "C# with ASP.NET Core", etc.

```bash
# Example with specific framework:
> /plan Create a REST API for a blog with posts and comments using Node.js with Express
```

**Plan mode output:**

```
📋 Implementation Plan

Step 1: Set up Express server
  - Initialize package.json
  - Install express, cors, body-parser
  - Create server.js with basic configuration

Step 2: Create data models
  - Post model (id, title, content, createdAt)
  - Comment model (id, postId, author, content, createdAt)

Step 3: Implement POST endpoints
  - POST /api/posts - Create new post
  - POST /api/posts/:id/comments - Add comment to post

Step 4: Implement GET endpoints
  - GET /api/posts - List all posts
  - GET /api/posts/:id - Get single post with comments

Step 5: Implement UPDATE/DELETE
  - PUT /api/posts/:id - Update post
  - DELETE /api/posts/:id - Delete post and its comments

Step 6: Add error handling
  - Validation middleware
  - Error response formatting

Proceed with implementation? [Y/n]
```

**Key insight**: Plan mode lets you review and modify the approach before any code is written. Perfect for complex features.

---

### Mode 3: Programmatic Mode

**Best for**: Automation, scripts, CI/CD, single-shot commands

Use the `-p` flag for one-time commands that don't need interaction:

```bash
# Generate code
copilot -p "Write a Python function to validate credit card numbers using the Luhn algorithm"
```

<details>
<summary>🎬 See it in action!</summary>

![Luhn Algorithm Demo](images/luhn-algorithm-demo.gif)

</details>

```bash
# Explain something
copilot -p "Explain the difference between let and const in JavaScript"

# Review a file
copilot -p "Review @myfile.js for performance issues"
```

#### Programmatic Mode in Scripts

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Generate commit messages automatically
COMMIT_MSG=$(copilot -p "Generate a commit message for: $(git diff --staged)")
git commit -m "$COMMIT_MSG"

# Generate documentation
copilot -p "Generate JSDoc comments for @src/utils.js" > docs/utils.md

# Security scan before deploy
copilot -p "Security review of @src/ - list critical issues only"
```

**Key insight**: Programmatic mode is perfect for automation. No interaction needed - just input and output.

## Essential Slash Commands

These commands work in interactive mode.

### 🚀 Start With These 4 Commands

Master these first - they cover 90% of daily use:

| Command | What It Does | Example |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| `/help` | Show all available commands | When you forget a command |
| `/clear` | Clear conversation and start fresh | When switching topics |
| `/plan` | Preview steps before coding | For complex features |
| `/exit` | End the session | When you're done |

### All Core Commands

| Command | What It Does | When to Use |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| `/help` | Show available commands | When you're unsure what's possible |
| `/clear` | Clear conversation history | Starting a new topic in same session |
| `/model` | Show or switch AI model | Testing different models |
| `/exit` | End the session | When you're done |
| `/plan` | Create implementation plan before coding | Complex features needing structure |
| `/review` | Run code-review agent | Before committing changes |
| `/delegate` | Hand off task to Copilot coding agent | Background work on GitHub |

### Session Commands

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/session` | Show session info and workspace summary |
| `/usage` | Display session usage metrics and statistics |
| `/context` | Show context window token usage |
| `/compact` | Summarize conversation to reduce context usage |
| `/share` | Export session as markdown file or GitHub gist |
| `/rename` | Rename the current session |
| `/resume` | Switch to a different session |

### Directory Access

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/add-dir <directory>` | Add a directory to allowed list |
| `/list-dirs` | Show all allowed directories |
| `/cwd`, `/cd [directory]` | View or change working directory |

### Configuration

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/theme` | View or set terminal theme (auto/dark/light/GitHub Dark/GitHub Light) |
| `/terminal-setup` | Enable multiline input support |
| `/user` | Manage GitHub accounts (show/list/switch) |
| `/feedback` | Submit feedback to GitHub |
| `/init` | Initialize Copilot instructions for your repository |

### Skills Management

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/skills list` | Show all available skills |
| `/skills info <name>` | Get details about a specific skill |
| `/skills reload` | Reload skills after editing |

> 💡 Skills are covered in detail in [Chapter 05](../05-skills/README.md).

### Permissions

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/allow-all` | Auto-approve all permission prompts for this session |
| `/yolo` | Alias for `/allow-all` (same behavior) |

> ⚠️ **Use with caution**: `/allow-all` and `/yolo` skip confirmation prompts. Great for trusted projects, but be careful with untrusted code.

### Quick Shell Commands

Run shell commands directly without AI by prefixing with `!`:

```bash
copilot

> !git status
# Runs git status directly, bypassing the AI

> !npm test
# Runs npm test directly
```

### The /delegate Command

The `/delegate` command hands off tasks to the Copilot coding agent on GitHub:

```bash
copilot

> /delegate Complete the API integration tests and fix any failing edge cases

# Or use the & prefix shortcut:
> & Add error handling to the login function

# Copilot:
# 1. Commits your changes to a new branch
# 2. Opens a draft pull request
# 3. Works on the task in the background
# 4. Requests your review when done
```

This is useful for tasks you want Copilot to complete independently while you work on something else.

### Switching Models

Different AI models have different strengths:

```bash
copilot
> /model

# Example output (your available models will vary):
Available models:
  - Claude Sonnet 4.5 (default)
  - Claude Opus 4.5
  - Gemini 3 Pro
  - GPT-5.2 Codex
  - GPT-5.1-Codex-Mini
  - More ...
```

> ⚠️ **Important**: The models shown above are examples only. Available models change frequently and vary based on your subscription, region, and GitHub Copilot updates. Always run `/model` to see your current options.

```bash
# Switch to a specific model
> /model gpt-5.2-codex
Model switched to gpt-5.2-codex

# Now use the new model
> Write a creative story opening about a space explorer
```

**Tips**:
- Try the same prompt with different models to see how their outputs differ
- Use `/model` to see currently available models (availability changes frequently)

## Preview: Three Ways to Extend Copilot CLI

Before we continue, let's understand the three extension mechanisms you'll learn in this course. This mental model will help everything make sense.

### Agents (Chapter 04): Change HOW the AI Thinks

Agents are specialized AI personalities with specific expertise. You define them in agent files and invoke them with the `/agent` command.

```bash
# Select an agent interactively
> /agent

# Or start with a specific agent
copilot --agent frontend
```

**When to use**: When you need specialized domain expertise.

### Skills (Chapter 05): Automatic Task Instructions

Skills are folders of instructions stored in `~/.copilot/skills/`. Copilot **automatically loads** them when your prompt matches the skill's description.

```bash
# Just ask naturally - Copilot loads matching skills automatically
> Review this code for security issues
# Copilot detects this matches your "security-audit" skill
# and applies its checklist automatically
```

**When to use**: For repetitive tasks that need consistent behavior.

### MCP Servers (Chapter 06): Connect to EXTERNAL Services

MCP (Model Context Protocol) connects Copilot to external data sources. Configure servers, then their tools become available.

```bash
# Configure MCP servers
> /mcp add

# Once configured, the tools are available to Copilot
# and it can use them automatically when relevant
```

**When to use**: When you need live data from external systems like GitHub, databases, or APIs.

### How They Work Together (Chapter 07)

```bash
# A complete workflow combining extensions
copilot --agent backend

# Copilot (with backend expertise) can now:
# - Access GitHub issues via MCP
# - Use your custom skills
# - Apply backend best practices
```

This is the power of GitHub Copilot CLI - and you'll master all of it by Chapter 07.

---

## Hands-On Examples

### Example 1: Interactive Exploration

```bash
copilot

> I'm building a Node.js API. What's the best way to structure the project?

> I want to use TypeScript. How does that change the structure?

> Create the initial folder structure and package.json for me

> /exit
```

### Example 2: Plan a Feature

```bash
copilot

> /plan Add user authentication with JWT to my Express app

# Review the plan
# Approve or modify
# Watch it implement step by step
```

### Example 3: Automate with Programmatic Mode

```bash

# Review all JavaScript files in src/
for file in src/*.js; do
  echo "Reviewing $file..."
  copilot -p "Quick security review of @$file - critical issues only"
done
```

---

## 🎯 Try It Yourself

After completing the demos, try these variations:

1. **Interactive Challenge**: Start `copilot` and build a function that validates email addresses. Ask for improvements 3 times in a row.

2. **Plan Mode Challenge**: Run `/plan Create a REST API for a todo list using [Your_Language/Framework]`. Read the plan carefully - does it make sense?

3. **Programmatic Challenge**: Run `copilot -p "Write a regex that matches phone numbers in format (XXX) XXX-XXXX"`. Did it work on the first try?

**Self-Check**: You understand the three modes when you can explain when NOT to use interactive mode (hint: one-off questions are faster with `-p`).

---

## Assignment

### Main Challenge: Master Interactive Mode

1. Start an interactive session: `copilot`
2. Ask Copilot to create a Python function that calculates factorials
3. Ask for error handling: "Add error handling for negative numbers"
4. Ask for a docstring: "Add a comprehensive docstring"
5. Observe how context carries between prompts
6. Exit with `/exit`

**Success criteria**: You should have a complete, documented factorial function with error handling, built through conversation.

<details>
<summary>💡 Hints (click to expand)</summary>

**Sample prompts to try:**
```bash
> Write a Python function that calculates the factorial of a number
> Add error handling for negative numbers and non-integers
> Add a comprehensive docstring with examples
```

**Common issues:**
- If Copilot asks clarifying questions, just answer them naturally
- Use `/clear` if you want to start over
- The context carries forward, so each prompt builds on the previous

</details>

### Bonus Challenge: Compare the Modes

Try this same task in all three modes:

1. **Interactive**: Build the function through conversation (as above)
2. **Plan**: Use `/plan Write a factorial function` to see the plan first
3. **Programmatic**: `copilot -p "Write a Python factorial function with error handling and docstring"`

**Reflection**: Which mode felt most natural? When would you use each?

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Model not available"

Your subscription may not include all models. Use `/model` to see what's available.

### "Context too long"

Your conversation has used the full context window. Use `/clear` to reset, or start a new session.

### "Rate limit exceeded"

Wait a few minutes and try again. Consider using programmatic mode for batch operations with delays.

### Interactive mode exits unexpectedly

Check your terminal configuration. Some terminals don't handle interactive sessions well. Try a different terminal emulator.

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Interactive mode** is for exploration and iteration - context carries forward
2. **Plan mode** is for complex tasks - review before implementation
3. **Programmatic mode** is for automation - no interaction needed
4. **Slash commands** (`/help`, `/clear`, `/model`, `/exit`) control your sessions
5. **Agents, Skills, and MCP** extend Copilot's capabilities - you'll learn each in upcoming chapters

> 📋 **Quick Reference**: See the [Command Cheat Sheet](../QUICK-REFERENCE.md) for a complete list of commands and shortcuts.

---

## What's Next

Now that you understand the three modes, let's learn how to give Copilot context about your code.

In **[Chapter 02: Context and Conversations](../02-context-conversations/README.md)**, you'll learn:

- The `@` syntax for referencing files and directories
- Session management with `--resume` and `--continue`
- How context management makes Copilot truly powerful
