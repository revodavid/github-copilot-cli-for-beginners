## Real-World Analogy: Master Craftsman's Workflow

A master carpenter doesn't just know how to use tools - they have *workflows* for different jobs:

| Job | Workflow |
|-----|----------|
| Building furniture | Measure → Cut → Assemble → Finish |
| Fixing damage | Assess → Remove → Repair → Match |
| Quality check | Inspect → Test joints → Check alignment |

Similarly, developers have workflows for different tasks. Copilot CLI enhances each one.

*Each workflow follows a clear progression of steps, all enhanced by Copilot CLI*

---

## Workflow 1: Code Review

### Basic Review

```bash
copilot

> Review @src/api/users.js for code quality
```

### Security-Focused Review

```bash
copilot

> Review @src/auth/login.js for security vulnerabilities. Check for: SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, insecure authentication, and sensitive data exposure
```

### Performance Review

```bash
copilot

> Review @src/services/dataProcessor.js for performance issues. Look for: unnecessary loops, memory leaks, inefficient algorithms, and blocking operations
```

### Interactive Code Review

```bash
copilot

> @src/api/users.js Review this file for:
> - Security vulnerabilities
> - Performance issues
> - Code style and best practices

# Copilot provides detailed review

> The SQL injection on line 23 - show me the fix

# Copilot shows the parameterized query fix

> Create a checklist of all issues found, prioritized by severity

# Copilot generates prioritized action items
```

### Review Checklist Template

```bash
copilot

> Review @src/api/ and create a markdown checklist of issues found, categorized by:
> - Critical (security vulnerabilities)
> - High (bugs, data corruption risks)
> - Medium (performance, maintainability)
> - Low (style, minor improvements)
```

### Using the /review Command

The `/review` command invokes the built-in **code-review agent**, which is optimized for analyzing staged and unstaged changes with high signal-to-noise output:

```bash
copilot

> /review
# Invokes the code-review agent on staged/unstaged changes
# Provides focused, actionable feedback

> /review Check for security issues in authentication
# Run review with specific focus area
```

> 💡 **What are staged and unstaged changes?**
> - **Staged changes**: Files you've marked for the next commit with `git add`
> - **Unstaged changes**: Files you've modified but haven't added yet
>
> To see your changes:
> ```bash
> git status           # Shows both staged and unstaged
> git diff             # Shows unstaged changes
> git diff --staged    # Shows staged changes
> ```

> 💡 **Tip**: The code-review agent works best when you have pending changes. Stage your files with `git add` for more focused reviews.

---

## Workflow 2: Refactoring

### Callback to Async/Await

```bash
copilot

> @legacy/userService.js This file uses callbacks. Refactor to async/await while:
> - Maintaining the same function signatures
> - Preserving error handling behavior
> - Adding TypeScript types
```

<details>
<summary>🎬 See it in action!</summary>

![Refactor Demo](images/refactor-demo.gif)

</details>

### Extract Duplication

```bash
copilot

> @src/controllers/userController.js @src/controllers/productController.js
> These files have duplicated error handling. Extract a common error handler.
```

### Modernize Legacy Code

```bash
copilot

> @legacy/oldModule.js Modernize this code:
> - Convert var to const/let
> - Use arrow functions where appropriate
> - Replace .then() chains with async/await
> - Add JSDoc comments
```

### Safe Refactoring with Tests

```bash
copilot

> @src/utils/dateHelpers.js Before refactoring, generate tests for current behavior

# Get tests first

> Now refactor the module to use date-fns instead of moment.js

# Refactor with confidence - tests verify behavior is preserved
```

---

## Workflow 3: Debugging

### The "Bug Detective" - AI Finds RELATED Bugs

This is where context-aware debugging shines. Try this scenario with a payments file:

```bash
copilot

> @samples/buggy-code/js/paymentProcessor.js
>
> Users report that $10.20 + $5.10 sometimes shows as $15.299999999999998
> Debug why this happens
```

<details>
<summary>🎬 See it in action!</summary>

![Fix Bug Demo](images/fix-bug-demo.gif)

</details>

**What Copilot does**:
```
Root Cause: Floating-point arithmetic issue in JavaScript.

Line 15: const total = amount1 + amount2
JavaScript represents numbers as 64-bit floating point, which can't
precisely represent some decimal values.

Fix: Use integer cents internally, convert for display only:
- Store amounts as cents (1020, 510)
- Calculate: 1020 + 510 = 1530
- Display: (1530 / 100).toFixed(2) = "$15.30"

ADDITIONAL ISSUE FOUND:
Line 28-34 has a race condition in the withdraw() function.
Multiple concurrent withdrawals could overdraw the account
because the balance check and update aren't atomic.

Recommend: Add transaction locking or use database transactions.
```

**Why this matters**: You asked about one bug, and Copilot found **another critical bug** you didn't know existed. The AI reads the whole file and spots related issues.

> 💡 **Common security terms you'll encounter:**
> - **SQL Injection**: When user input is put directly into a database query, allowing attackers to run malicious commands
> - **Parameterized queries**: The safe alternative - placeholders (`?`) separate user data from SQL commands
> - **Race condition**: When two operations happen at the same time and interfere with each other
> - **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**: When attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages

---

### Understanding an Error

```bash
copilot

> I'm getting this error:
> TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined
>     at UserList (src/components/UserList.jsx:15:23)
>
> @src/components/UserList.jsx Explain why and how to fix it
```

### Debugging with Test Case

```bash
copilot

> @src/api/payments.js This endpoint returns 500 errors for this input:
> {"amount": -100, "currency": "USD"}
>
> Debug this: explain the root cause and provide a fix with input validation
```

### Trace an Issue Through Code

```bash
copilot

> Users report that orders are sometimes duplicated.
> @src/services/orderService.js @src/api/orders.js @src/utils/idGenerator.js
> Trace through the order creation flow and identify where duplication could occur
```

### Log Analysis

```bash
copilot

> @logs/error.log Analyze these errors and identify:
> 1. Most common error types
> 2. Patterns in timing or frequency
> 3. Likely root causes
> 4. Suggested fixes
```

---

## Workflow 4: Test Generation

### The "Test Explosion" - 2 Tests vs 15+ Tests

Manually writing tests, developers typically create 2-3 basic tests:
- Test valid input
- Test invalid input
- Maybe one edge case

Watch what happens when you ask Copilot:

```bash
copilot

> @samples/buggy-code/js/userService.js Generate Jest tests for the login function covering:
> - Valid login
> - Invalid password
> - Non-existent user
> - null/undefined inputs
> - SQL injection attempts
> - Timing attack resistance
```

**What you get**: 15+ comprehensive tests including:

```javascript
describe('login', () => {
  // Happy path
  test('returns user object for valid credentials', ...);
  test('generates valid JWT token', ...);

  // Authentication failures
  test('rejects invalid password', ...);
  test('rejects non-existent user', ...);
  test('rejects empty password', ...);
  test('rejects null username', ...);

  // Security tests
  test('blocks SQL injection in username', ...);
  test('blocks SQL injection in password', ...);
  test('escapes special characters', ...);

  // Timing attack resistance
  test('constant-time comparison for passwords', ...);
  test('same response time for valid vs invalid users', ...);

  // Edge cases
  test('handles unicode in password', ...);
  test('handles very long passwords', ...);
  test('handles concurrent login attempts', ...);
});
```

**Result**: In 30 seconds, you get security tests that would take an hour to think through and write.

---

### Unit Tests

```bash
copilot

> @src/utils/validation.js Generate comprehensive unit tests using Jest:
> - Test all exported functions
> - Include edge cases: null, undefined, empty strings
> - Include boundary testing
> - Include error cases
```

### Integration Tests

```bash
copilot

> @src/api/users.js Generate integration tests using supertest:
> - Test all endpoints
> - Test authentication requirements
> - Test validation errors
> - Test successful operations
> - Include setup and teardown
```

### Test for Specific Scenarios

```bash
copilot

> @src/services/paymentService.js Generate tests for these scenarios:
> - Successful payment
> - Insufficient funds
> - Invalid card
> - Network timeout
> - Duplicate transaction prevention
```

### Add Tests to Existing File

```bash
copilot

> @src/utils/helpers.js @tests/helpers.test.js
> The test file exists but doesn't cover the formatCurrency function.
> Add tests for formatCurrency with edge cases
```

---

## Workflow 5: Git Integration

### Generate Commit Messages

```bash

# See what changed
git diff --staged

# Generate commit message
copilot -p "Generate a conventional commit message for: $(git diff --staged)"

# Output: "feat(auth): add JWT refresh token rotation
#
# - Implement automatic token refresh before expiration
# - Add refresh token storage in httpOnly cookie
# - Update auth middleware to handle refresh flow"
```

### Explain Changes

```bash
# What did this commit change?
copilot -p "Explain what this commit does: $(git show HEAD --stat)"
```

### PR Description

```bash
# Generate PR description from branch changes
copilot -p "Generate a pull request description for these changes:
$(git log main..HEAD --oneline)

Include:
- Summary of changes
- Why these changes were made
- Testing done
- Screenshots needed? (yes/no)"
```

### Review Before Push

```bash
# Last check before pushing
copilot -p "Review these changes for issues before I push:
$(git diff main..HEAD)"
```

### Using /delegate for Background Tasks

The `/delegate` command hands off work to the Copilot coding agent on GitHub:

```bash
copilot

> /delegate Add input validation to the login form

# Or use the & prefix shortcut:
> & Fix the typo in the README header

# Copilot:
# 1. Commits your changes to a new branch
# 2. Opens a draft pull request
# 3. Works in the background on GitHub
# 4. Requests your review when done
```

This is great for well-defined tasks you want completed while you focus on other work.

### Using /diff to Review Session Changes

The `/diff` command shows all changes made during your current session:

```bash
copilot

# After making some changes...
> /diff

# Shows a visual diff of all files modified in this session
# Great for reviewing before committing
```

---

## Putting It All Together: Bug Fix Workflow

Here's a complete workflow for fixing a reported bug:

```bash

# 1. Understand the bug report
copilot

> Users report: 'Login fails with special characters in password'
> @src/auth/login.js @src/utils/validation.js
> Analyze and identify the likely cause

# 2. Debug the issue (continuing in same session)
> Based on the analysis, the issue is in password validation.
> @src/utils/validation.js Show me line 34 and explain the regex issue

> Fix the validatePassword function to handle special characters

# 3. Generate tests for the fix
> @src/utils/validation.js Generate tests specifically for:
> - Passwords with special characters (!@#$%^&*)
> - Passwords with unicode characters
> - Passwords with spaces

# 4. Generate commit message
copilot -p "Generate commit message for: $(git diff --staged)"

# Output: "fix(auth): handle special characters in password validation"
```

### Bug Fix Workflow Summary

| Step | Action | Copilot Command |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Understand the bug | `> [describe bug] @relevant-file.js Analyze the likely cause` |
| 2 | Get detailed analysis | `> Show me line X and explain the issue` |
| 3 | Implement the fix | `> Fix the [specific issue]` |
| 4 | Generate tests | `> Generate tests for [specific scenarios]` |
| 5 | Commit | `copilot -p "Generate commit message for: $(git diff --staged)"` |

## 🎯 Try It Yourself

After completing the demos, try these variations:

1. **Bug Detective Challenge**: Ask Copilot to debug the `getCachedUser` race condition in userService.js. Did it explain why checking `if (!userCache[userId])` is dangerous with async code?

2. **Test Challenge**: Generate tests for the `createUser` function. Count how many edge cases Copilot includes that you wouldn't have thought of.

3. **Commit Message Challenge**: Make any small change to a file, stage it (`git add .`), then run:
   ```bash
   copilot -p "Generate a conventional commit message for: $(git diff --staged)"
   ```
   Is the message better than what you would have written quickly?

**Self-Check**: You understand development workflows when you can explain why "debug this bug" is more powerful than "find bugs" (context matters!).

---

## Sample Files for Practice

The `samples/buggy-code/` folder contains intentionally buggy code in both JavaScript and Python. Use these to practice the workflows:

### JavaScript Examples

```bash
copilot

# Security audit on user service
> @samples/buggy-code/js/userService.js Perform a security audit

# Review payment processor
> @samples/buggy-code/js/paymentProcessor.js Find all bugs
```

### Python Examples

```bash
copilot

# Security audit on user service
> @samples/buggy-code/python/user_service.py Perform a security audit

# Review payment processor (includes Python-specific issues like pickle, eval, yaml)
> @samples/buggy-code/python/payment_processor.py Find all bugs
```

The Python versions include language-specific vulnerabilities like:
- Pickle deserialization attacks
- `eval()` code injection
- Insecure `yaml.load()`
- Shell injection via `os.system()`
- Weak MD5 password hashing

---

## Assignment

### Main Challenge: Complete Development Workflow

Using one of the sample files (`samples/buggy-code/js/userService.js` or `samples/buggy-code/python/user_service.py`):

1. **Review**: Run a comprehensive security review
2. **Identify**: Create a prioritized list of issues
3. **Fix**: Refactor the most critical issue (SQL injection)
4. **Test**: Generate tests for the fixed code
5. **Commit**: Generate a proper commit message

Document each step and the Copilot output.

<details>
<summary>💡 Hints (click to expand)</summary>

**Sample prompts for each step:**

```bash
copilot

# Step 1: Review
> @samples/buggy-code/js/userService.js Run a comprehensive security review

# Step 2: Identify
> Create a prioritized list of issues. Rank by severity (critical, high, medium, low)

# Step 3: Fix
> Fix the SQL injection vulnerability. Show me the before and after code.

# Step 4: Test
> Generate Jest tests for the fixed userService, including tests that would catch SQL injection

# Step 5: Commit
> Generate a commit message for these security fixes
```

**Expected findings in the sample file:**
- SQL injection (critical)
- Missing input validation
- Hardcoded credentials
- Missing error handling

**Tip:** If you want to save your fixed file, ask: "Write the fixed code to a new file called userService-fixed.js"

</details>

### Bonus Challenge: Full Bug Fix

1. Create a file with an intentional bug of your choice
2. Use Copilot to identify the bug
3. Get a fix from Copilot
4. Generate tests that would have caught the bug
5. Generate a commit message that explains the fix

---

## Troubleshooting

### Review seems incomplete

Be more specific about what to look for:

```bash
copilot

# Instead of:
> Review @file.js

# Try:
> Review @file.js for security vulnerabilities, specifically: SQL injection, XSS, and authentication issues
```

### Tests don't match my framework

Specify the framework:

```bash
copilot

> @file.js Generate tests using Mocha and Chai (not Jest)
```

### Refactoring changes behavior

Ask Copilot to preserve behavior:

```bash
copilot

> @file.js Refactor to async/await. IMPORTANT: Maintain identical external behavior - no breaking changes
```

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Code review** becomes comprehensive with specific prompts
2. **Refactoring** is safer when you generate tests first
3. **Debugging** benefits from showing Copilot the error AND the code
4. **Test generation** should include edge cases and error scenarios
5. **Git integration** automates commit messages and PR descriptions

> 📋 **Quick Reference**: See the [Command Cheat Sheet](../QUICK-REFERENCE.md) for a complete list of commands and shortcuts.

## Building Your Personal Workflow

There's no single "right" way to use GitHub Copilot CLI. Teams and individuals develop their own patterns over time. Here's how to build yours:

### Start with Plan Mode

For anything non-trivial, start with `/plan` and refine it before execution:

```bash
copilot

> /plan Add user authentication to this Express app
```

Go back and forth until you like the plan. A good plan leads to better results.

### Document What Works

When you find prompts that work well, save them. When Copilot makes a mistake, note what went wrong and how you corrected it. Over time, this becomes your personal playbook.

> 💡 **Coming in Chapter 04**: You'll learn about custom instruction files that let you codify these learnings so Copilot remembers them automatically.

### Turn Repetitive Tasks into Skills

If you do something more than once a day, it's a candidate for a skill:

- End-of-session cleanup (find duplicated code, remove dead code)
- Pre-commit checks (security scan, lint, test)
- PR description generation

> 💡 **Coming in Chapter 05**: You'll learn how to create skills that Copilot loads automatically based on your prompt.

### Experiment Freely

What works for one developer may not work for another. Some prefer long, detailed prompts. Others prefer short prompts with follow-up questions. Some use Plan mode for everything; others rarely touch it.

Try different approaches and notice what feels natural for your workflow.
